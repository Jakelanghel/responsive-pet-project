                         but once he gets to know you he'll quickly become your best friend. He is a very happy 
                         and playful boy who loves going to the river for a swim or down to the park to play some 
                         fetch. He use to be a free-range dog but as of late he is not to be trusted around the 
                         garbage un-supervised.

                    <p>Winter is that good stick weather!! The frozen sticks are 
                        easier to chomp into pieces, and Len loves him some chompin. I let him carry a stick home from the park 
                        almost evey day. He carries them home and adds them to his vast stick collection..all the neighborhood 
                        dogs are so jealous.

                        <p> When we go on walks after it rains I have to really keep an eye on him, or he'll lay down 
                            in a dirty mud puddle. He also tries to dig holes in the baseball field if your not watching, and I can't 
                            figure out if he does it because he likes diggin, or he's tired of those kids ruining his fetch time.
